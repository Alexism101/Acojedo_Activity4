    <p>on last DECEMBER 2024, In December 2024, we tried and successfully reached our destinationâ€”to go to Starbuks. It
        wasn't part of our original plan. It was more like a sudden, spontaneous decision that quickly pushed through.

        These individuals have once been a significant part of my life. They are the ones who give me a sense of
        worth, especially in times of difficulty, and they are the first to notice whenever I am struggling, no
        matter how much I try to hide it. I cannot fully comprehend why they are always by my side or by each
        other's side. Each of us carries different experiences and challenges. I may not know who is enduring the
        most, but we all understand that every one of us needs attention, understanding, and prayer. We have faced
        many disagreements among ourselves, yet these never hinder us from preserving our friendship, for we regard
        every challenge as a test of our bond.
