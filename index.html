            My name is Alexander D. Acojedo. 22 years old and my birthday is May
            29, 2003. I studied different schools as an Elementary, High school,
            and Senior high school student. Not in relationship and single. I
            got a height of about 155 cm or 5'1 ft. Brown skin and not really
            skinny and not really buffed. I like to eat seafood aside from fish,
            like shrimp, shells, and seaweed. Loves to listen to different
            genres of music, like romantic, slowed, and rap, and at the same
            time, calm.

          <p class="desc">
            I have the ability to create animations. I have the ability also to
            create comics and can compose a song as well. I can make a portrait,
            sketch or even a realism art. I tried and always try to play music
            in any different kinds of instruments. I refuse dancing and acting

          I automatically can't be proud when someone normalizes going to bars
          and clubs. No deal with those who chose war over peace. I don't
          appreciate those people who throw their trashes away. I hate those who
          have no respect in general terms. I'll dispose those people who shows
          no kindess in all living things. On the other hand, I congratulate
          people who lower their patience always. I love those people who put
          GOD first. I like those people who understands and have a emotional
          intelligence. I will always choose to go to the person who always
          listens and doesn't insist on their same experience when someone is
          sharing in front of them.

        <h4 class="title-3">Why I Chose BSIT?</h4>
        <p class="desc-2">
          First of all, BSIT is not my dream course. BSIT is in the list of the
          courses that I want to choose when I go to college. My first course I
          want to take is Fine Arts then next Architectural, next Physcology
          down to Philosphy and lastly BSIT. I picked BSIT course since I found
          out that I have an interest of games. How games are created? what
          course to take when creating games? since my childhood, I use to draw
          something and make it a game with my friends in my Elementary days. we
          are all busy in making it up and put some updates even though its just
          a drawing. And now, I found that BSIT has the ability to create
          everything inside a computer, considering games. I know BSIT is not
          that easy as I expected before. BSIT is so broad you can only chose
          one way much better. You can be a person called "FULL STACK
          DEVELOPER." But again, many sacrifices and deadly moments will happen
          first before reaching the top.

              I just wanted to feel the moment like everyone doesn't know how
              time is so fast, and I make it slow. The air was so fresh during
              those times. But honestly, I really felt the craving for the sea
              and how nice it would be to take a swim.
            </p>

              It looks like I was frowning here. It was a stolen picture taken
              by one of my friends. At that time, the three who were with us
              went to get some extra food and drinking water from the city. The
              city was quite a distance from that place.

              Camp time, that sunrise. I had just woken up that morning during
              those days and was simply staring at the beautiful surroundings
              that I had never discovered before. It was the very first sunrise
              I had ever seen in my whole life.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="adventure-card">
            <img src="./images/adv4.jpg" alt="Adventure 4" />
            <p>
              Last MAY 25, 2025, we camped at Tabogon, Kabilin cove over 1 day
              and 2 nights. We reach there at 9:50pm on May 25. I don't know or
              I can't remember if we have finished eating.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="adventure-card">
            <img src="./images/adv5.jpg" alt="Adventure 5" />
            <p>
              The moment after we install our tents in our camp adventure, we
              take a picture like waiting for the foods to be cooked. We took
              quite a few photos while we were waiting for our food to be
              cooked. The weather was cold at that time, and the hunger really
              matched the mood — we couldn't wait to eat.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="adventure-card">
            <img src="./images/adv6.jpg" alt="Adventure 6" />
            <p>
              At this moment, I woke up early. And I know I might only
              experience this once — I’m not even sure if it will happen again.
              So, I took the chance to enjoy the view with a simple cup of
              coffee.
            </p>

          <div class="adventure-card">
            <img src="./images/adv7.jpg" alt="Adventure 7" />
            <p>
              And at this time, we have reached our exact location where we will
              camp. So, what we did was immediately set up our tents, just in
              case it rains, because the sky suddenly seemed to darken.
            </p>

              Last May 4, 2025 also we visited the first holy door church here
              in cebu at Danao, Cebu. We have a pilgrimage that day, and this is
              the first church we are destined to visit. We didn't stay here
              long either and went to another place, which is the second church
              we are going to visit.

            <p>
              The moment that we bought small foods for our small trip to
              Starbuks. Even at that time, everyone was already hungry. When we
              got to Starbucks, I could tell that the food wasn't enough — it
              was more like something just to tide us over. Good thing we didn't
              stay there long.

            <p>
              On last DECEMBER 2024, In December 2024, we tried and successfully
              reached our destination—to go to Starbuks. It wasn't part of our
              original plan. It was more like a sudden, spontaneous decision
              that quickly pushed through.

            <img src="./images/adv11.jpg" alt="Adventure 11" />
            <p>
              The moment that we almost reach the Starbuks last DECEMBER 2024 we
              stopped for a while. We were first admiring the beautiful
              buildings with lights. It felt like we were in a fantasy world at
              that moment.

              Last year we go to a Resort where I just want to go. But the truth
              is, we got there cause that place is chosen where to celebrate my
              Aunt's birthday. But I really enjoyed being with my siblings and
              cousins, as well as the nieces and nephews from my aunt's side.

              We celebrated the birthday of this smurf in IT DEPARTMENT in
              University of Cebu last April, 14 2024. This friend of mine on the
              right side (the one holding the camera) was a BSMT student (back
              then), but had to stop due to financial problems. He was with us
              because we had planned this together.

            <p>
              What I meant was, this is my friend who celebrated their birthday
              on April 14, 2024. I actually requested that it be just the two of
              us in the photo — so that if ever I die, they'd have something to
              post. HAHAHA just kidding, of course.
