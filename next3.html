        Back in 2016, when I was in Grade 7, I once again tried to take part in art exhibits. However, I couldn't make
        it
        into the bigger ones, since there were many who were more skilled and knowledgeable in design. Still, that
        didn't measure my worth, because I was slowly learning and gradually improving in drawing. As the years passed
        and the pandemic came to an end, I suddenly lost the passion for the art I had been so used to. But maybe that's
        alright. I believe I can recover quickly, because art has already become a part of meâ€”it feels like it's
        built-in.</p>
